        <p>Before we begin, a little background on what we're making. Birria actually a stew made from adult goat. We make ours with beef because its more available.  Using the short rib is to replicate the broth that comes from the bone flavor. Birria Queso is the latest trend to increase the popularity of the stew.  The crispy tacos are dipped in the broth, called consome, for added flavor.</p>

        <h2> For the stew</h2>
        <p>
            For this recipe, we will be using the Instapot. Start by placing short ribs in the pot and enough water to cover.  Pressure cook on high for 30-40 minutes. Release pressure and remove lid. Skim bonf scum and excess oil from the water. Cut chuck roast into 4 to 6 pieces and place in pot. Add the rest of the stew ingredients.  Pressure cook for 45 minutes, to 1 hour and 15 minutes for more tender roast. Release pressure and set lid aside.  Put cooker in saute more to boil and reduce the broth some. Remove guajillo pepper and all vegetables that are intact. Place in blender with some of the broth and blend until smooth.  Remove all the meat and bones from broth. Let cool.  Shred all the beef with forks or cube with knife and remove the fat and bones.  Set aside. Return blended vegetables to pot and stir. Change pot to "hold warm" option. put about 1 to 2 ladlefull of broth over the meat.</p>
           <h2>For the tacos</h2> 
           <p>Have the onions and cilantro prepped and have the cheese, meat, broth, and tortillas ready near the stove as we have to assemble tacos quickly. Preheat a skillet with 1-2 Tbsp of oil over medium high heat. When ready, lightly dip a tortilla into the broth and immediately place in hot pan. Fry for about 30 seconds, or until tortill can be flipped without tearing.  Flip tortilla and immediately assemble taco with cheese first (the melted cheese will hold the other ingredients in place), followed by a spoonful of meat, and a generous pinch of onion and cilantro. Using a spatula, carefully fold taco in half. Firmly press taco together and let brown on both sides. Removed an place on paper towel lined plate and repeat.   </p>
